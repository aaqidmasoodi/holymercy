        into the supernatural, where all that is spiritual is tangible, and all
        that is tangible is spiritual. Where each has distinct characteristics,
        though they are one in the same as faith has evolved. We are, and will
        always be, spirit and soul foremost, where the spiritual and
        supernatural are the essence of the corporeal and natural, and where the
        power and definition of the breath of life come from. Which are here in
        this world as a part of our bodies to learn about the sustenance of all
        worldly spiritual truths to prepare us for all that lies ahead. And no
        matter where we go from here or what form we take when we leave this
        world, we will always be defined by the essence of our spirit and our
        soul. With that in mind and that in truth, let us journey to a place
        where the physical and the material are defined by spiritual truths
        alone. To a place within faith that does not question or doubt a single
        word that has been revealed to us through Christ, therefore always
        allowing for unknown truths to be revealed. Where new awareness starts
        once one opens their eyes to the heavenly and begins to transform their
        faith. It will be so awesome for you to go with me there, now that you
        have removed the boundaries that had kept your faith from reaching
        greater spiritual realities. Now that you know that faith is limitless,
        you are free to go where you have never been before. All the heavens
        have been waiting for you to learn their celestial truths about all that
        this great mystery of life is about. It took me a long time to learn how
        to get there, and now that I know the way, I will share it with you. I
        know you've been curious about all that lies on the other side. It is
        not a mystery at all; it's really quite simple once you open your
        consciousness, your spirit, and your soul to it all. This is when it all
        begins to be revealed. This is when life begins to make sense. It is the
        ultimate reality that defines the reasons for life and compels believers
        to be ambitious in their pursuit of spiritual blessings while awakening
        their natural senses to the ultimate truths of the spirit, the soul, the
        heavenly realms, and God. Now that you believe that anything is possible
        through faith, you are free to venture into the spiritual unknown that I
        have become aware of. Before we begin our journey, there are many
        spiritual truths about the unknowns that I need to share with you in
        advance. By thought, or by spirit, or by faith, it would be difficult to
        conceive of what actually exists on the other side until one begins to
        learn for themselves. And yes, the closer one gets to the Holy Spirit,
        both inwardly and outwardly, the more that is revealed. That is how
        faith and spiritual growth work. Once confidence progresses far beyond
        doubt, one becomes even more connected with all that is over there. This
        is how you and they both know you are being drawn closer. This is how
        you learn what they want to share. It happens through faith as it grows.
        We don't have to die for our spirits to learn about everything that
        exists on the other side. Through Christ and with the Holy Spirit
        dwelling inside one's soul, the supernatural unknowns become known. All
        is revealed to each one at just the right time when it needs to be
        revealed, so prepare yourself to enter the most awesome spiritual life
        you could've only imagined before. It is waiting for you to get familiar
        with it all. Prepare yourself to get even closer to our Holy Lord. If
        one is not prepared with Holy Scripture knowledge to explore the
        spiritual unknowns, the facts concerning spiritual truths will not be
        revealed. One must learn what the Word of God is revealing to be
        confident enough to walk into the light. To be in Christ is to be in
        total union with His all. This is when all the blessings of all
        spiritual strengths and truths. This is why it is important to always
        strive to learn as much as possible about the light of God, the
        mysteries of faith, the behaviors of the spirit of self, and the light
        that is the essence of the soul. Once one begins to learn about these
        mysteries, it is a never-ending journey of spiritual growth and the
        greatest purposes for everlasting life. It's all about elevating faith
        to the next level, one step at a time. The first thing to understand and
        always remember is that everything in the spiritual and supernatural
        realms is made up of spirits, energies, forces, and powers of either
        light or darkness. Light and darkness cannot exist together in any one
        form, spirit, power, or entity. There is no compromise of this law of
        God that exists anywhere in all of existence. There is no in-between;
        there never has been and there never will be; it's either one side or
        the other. Light exists in some form or another in all of creation.
        Light can pierce the darkness, but darkness cannot pierce the light.
        Darkness cannot exist in the light, though light can exist in darkness.
        The majority of all spirits and religions in the world are directly
        connected to the holy light of God. Do not judge and do not
        discriminate; we are all seeking to attain the same spiritual truths
        that our spirits and souls so desperately need. If one seeks all that is
        holy, there is much to learn to make sure one is always protected. In
        the heavenly and spiritual realms, it is quite vast, with many unknown
        extremes. While some will welcome you and bless you, others will try to
        manipulate and destroy you. In the realms, it is sometimes difficult to
        distinguish between powers of light and powers of darkness. Unless, of
        course, one has the Holy Spirit, which is the holy light of God dwelling
        inside their souls. This alone is the most important truth to possess,
        which is the strongest power ever known. This is needed to have total
        discernment over the origins of all spirits, energies, forces, and
        powers. The life of a Christian is to always be aware that spiritual
        warfare between light and darkness is constant and continual. Most
        realms are ruled by powers of light or darkness. There are many that
        consist of both, such as our own world, Earth. These are the places
        where spiritual wars are raging for dominance and authority. As a
        Christian, this will not affect us, just as long as faith is strong and
        one is aware of the truths. I will share with you all that I know now
        that we are here together, so that it may help you prepare for all that
        surely lies ahead. The spiritual life that we each possess began before
        our first awareness of spirit came to mind. The spirit of self was
        always there, just waiting to be recognized. What is this that they call
        the spiritual? For everyone, this awakening happens at different stages
        in life. For some, it happens early when they are young, and for others,
        it happens later. And for some, it doesn't happen until they get to the
        other side. We all want to live forever. And we all want to find the way
        to Heaven. Let me share with you where my awareness of the spiritual
        began. For me, it began with the presence of a higher power that came to
        visit me. I couldn't explain it. All I knew was that it was definitive
        spiritual reality. That's when my spiritual journey to find the truth
        began. The goal is to recognize the spirit of self and learn about its
        capabilities. Let's start with the spirit of self. Everyone has a
        spirit; we are each born with our own. Just as conscientiousness
        matures, so does the spirit of self. Everyone possesses a very unique
        spirit. You are your own individual conscience, spirit, and soul, unlike
        anyone else in the world. The mystery of the spirit of self continues to
        transform and grow in strength throughout life. Your own spirit is a
        precise reflection of all that consists of your innermost self that
        connects to the heavens above. This is how the heavens and the spiritual
        realms know exactly where you stand and how strong and true you really
        are. This is how the spiritual energies connect with or repel the spirit
        of your own; it's not by choice; it's by awareness of spiritual truths
        or not. They know your spirit as well as you do. No one can hide from
        their own higher truths. What the spirit of self consists of and
        connects with is all that really matters when it comes to higher powers
        when they begin to take control. There are spirits who will protect you,
        whether you know it or not. They will protect you because they see the
        light that is in your soul. All of one's own desires, values, morals,
        emotions, faith, will, hopes, joys, fears, strengths, weaknesses, and
        everything else that defines oneself radiate from within. The spirit of
        self is composed of the energy of the conscience and soul and reflects
        everything one is living for and dying for. Its nature is to be an ally
        to all other forces within oneself, to be a distinct and individual
        force, even though it recognizes that it is most powerful when combined
        with holiness. All of one's internal spiritual forces must be in harmony
        and work together in unison rather than separately for continual
        revelations to occur. If someone blesses their spirit, the spirit will
        reveal itself and share its purposes for your life. If one is unaware of
        their spirit, their spirit waits patiently for faith to grow enough to
        discover its presence. All the while waiting for its complete surrender
        to only you. Once the spirit of self is recognized, it becomes
        overjoyed, knowing that it is no longer on its own. It finds comfort and
        contentment in the will of its beholder; that is where it belongs. Once
        discovered, it will teach you everything you will need to know to
        prepare you for a blessed spiritual life. The spirit of self must be in
        harmony with its ally, the self-conscience, to ever attempt to explore
        the spiritual unknown. Conscience is a spirit and a force, just as
        self-spirit and soul are as well. And all must be joined for spiritual
        growth to gradually occur and make it into the heavens. I will begin by
        sharing the basic principles that need to be known to ensure that all of
        your future spiritual encounters are pleasurable. You, alone, are the
        only one that has ultimate command over all that your conscience, your
        spirit, and your soul consist of. These together are the sum of all that
        defines each person's own spiritual identity. The self-conditioning of
        these forces is essential to gaining self-control and maintaining
        ultimate self-authority and integrity. These three individual life
        forces must work together in harmony to gain the most prosperous
        spiritual life possible. Conditioning is a process of learning, and for
        a Christian, it's about learning the basics of all spiritual truths. One
        cannot learn these truths without referencing, researching, and
        meditating on the Holy Scriptures. There are no other short cuts or any
        other way for spiritual truths to be experienced, revealed, or
        explained. Once learned, they must be applied to one's life and not
        altered or changed to allow for self-justification. Just as your body
        needs proper nourishment to attain optimum health, so does the
        conscience, the spirit, and the soul. The spirit and soul always seek to
        be nourished. They thrive on the fruits of the spirit, which are love,
        joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and
        self-control. One of the reasons they are called fruit is because they
        are spiritual food for spiritual nourishment and growth. The spirit
        doesn't like being introduced to any that are the opposites of these
        fruits, such as hate, anger, or any other negative energies. This will
        cause the spirit to become unhealthy and unhappy and experience grief
        and pain. The spirit hungers for all that is holy and true; it yearns
        for comfort, companionship, and love. And as awareness grows, the spirit
        of self becomes capable of reasoning for itself, obliging the very faith
        and soul of the person to whom it belongs. Everything that exists
        spiritually consists of either positive or negative forces. Negative is
        anything that is disruptive towards the positive majority. Positive is
        everything that blesses and is beneficial for spiritual growth. If you
        feed your spirit and soul nourishing energy and fuel, you bless your
        self and your spirit gets blessed and blesses you back, and blesses
        others in return. If you feed and fuel your living soul with anything
        and everything that is holy, your soul will rejoice and bless and praise
        all that is of Heaven and God. It's best not to associate oneself with
        any questionable or negative spiritual energy for optimum spiritual
        growth to occur. Inside and outside influences determine everything that
        is of faith, spirituality, and the supernatural that is of oneself. It's
        all about one's faith; faith has ultimate authority over all the forces
        of life, of the natural world, and of the supernatural that one's self
        connects with. That's about how basic and simple the answer gets to
        preparing yourself for success. You can easily define the spiritual
        condition of your life by the way you live it. You are solely
        responsible for the quantity and quality of your faith. One alone
        determines their own spiritual destiny through every action they take
        and every thought they have. Every action and every thought of one's
        self simultaneously affect one's spiritual state of existence. All
        thoughts of the mind, all desires of the body, all yearnings of the
        heart, and all that is of the will of the soul are what create the
        condition of one’s spirit of self. This all begins to happen early in
        life, even before conscious awareness of these human capabilities is
        recognized. As a child, one’s spirit instinctively yearns for nurturing
        love. In this young stage, depending on the quality and quantity of love
        that each child receives, this yearning begins to shape and condition
        one’s spirit. As one matures physically and mentally, the spirit of self
        continues to develop both dependently and independently. Independently
        through free will and dependently through all closest influences.
        Consider these conditions wisely when it comes to caring for the young.
        You and the spirit you possess influence all that you come into contact
        with, for better or for worse, with or without your own knowledge of
        this fact. Self-spirit is everything you make your life force to be
        through the condition of conscience. It is an invisible force that is
        energized by perceptions and reasons for living; it cannot be seen but
        is easily felt. The condition of one's spirit and its actions are in
        direct accordance with one's own state of mind. When thoughts are of
        positive energy, the spirit of self is in command and blesses. When
        thoughts are of negative energy, the spirit of self is not in command
        and is being influenced by adverse energies. This is the nature of one's
        own spirit. Be careful of outside influences, because without your
        consent and control, it will be left defenseless. A weak spirit will
        influence every other energy one possesses. One must learn to control
        their own spirit, because if they don't, outside energies, forces, or
        powers will. Without the Holy Spirit being the dominant power that
        oversees one's entire life, outside energies will penetrate all that is
        vulnerable and do their best to undermine it, without one's knowledge or
        will. You don't want this to happen, because if it does, you will be
        battling forces and spirits to regain command. and sometimes that is
        easier said than done. Just keep your mind on all that is holy, and
        you'll never have to worry about losing your own authority. Your spirit
        does bless you if you bless it well and let it teach you its secrets for
        your own good. The spirit of self is both such a delicate energy and a
        powerful force to learn about and from. Yes, the spirit of self will
        teach you everything that it knows; it knows answers and truths that
        will help make us strong. Though it can't reveal its secrets until
        spiritual growth is sufficient to be reassured, it knows when you are
        listening to it and knows if you are wasting its time. It yearns to be
        acknowledged and waits patiently to be energized by observance. The
        spirit of self is a fluid form of spiritual matter all on its own that
        takes time to be identified by the mind and heart of its owner. It roams
        on its own at times until it is noticed. There are rules for its
        existence that cannot be compromised. Through recognition, one becomes
        aware of its actions and learns to understand the reasons why it does
        all the things that it does. For better or worse, the spirit is obedient
        to all that belongs to its recipient. Spirit collaborates in union with
        all of one's own energies because of the insight into all that it is
        capable of. Its innermost home is in the heart, in the soul, and in the
        will. And each must work together to achieve the same goals. Once one
        learns of its existence, it is easy to fully understand its desires. It
        has rules that must be kept, and it always seeks to be fulfilled. Above
        all, it yearns for all that is holy and true to be lively. If you fuel
        your spirit well with righteousness, it will bless you and guide you
        continually. Everyone has their own spirit and will that they must learn
        from as faith grows. Knowing one's spirit and dye is more blessed in the
        afterlife than never knowing either, because everything in the afterlife
        is ruled by light and spirit. Will and spirit both work together to
        achieve your spiritual goals, and both yearn for your ultimate purpose
        in life to be fulfilled. Your mystery of the soul and your knowledge of
        the spirit are two of the most important purposes of life; no one, or no
        power, that exists in all of creation will ever know all that it is
        capable of, except you and God. Allow your spirit to learn to be in
        harmony with your body, heart, and mind; then your spirit will become an
        unstoppable force, learning to be a part of all that is eternal and
        gifting knowledge of higher and holier dimensions. Our awareness of
        these blessings brings the wisdom of faith, which feeds the spirit and
        fuels the soul with all that is of the everlasting and teaches us each
        of our own life force, of the forces of nature, of the supernatural, and
        of the powers of light and darkness, though most importantly, of the
        powers of God. The properties of the spirit consist of mysteries waiting
        to be revealed as spiritual awareness grows. The spirit has a
        like-minded quality of attraction to other energies, forces, and spirits
        like its own. Though, above all, it wishes to be content with the
        conscience and soul to which it belongs. This is the spirit’s home. It
        dwells somewhere within. Never forget that the spirit of self attracts
        like energies and repels unlike energies; this is its very essence.
        Spirit is ultimately influenced by actions and thoughts and by all
        spiritual and supernatural energies it comes into contact with, for
        better or for worse. Nothing can separate your own conscience, spirit,
        or soul—no power, no love, no depth, and no will can. They are forever
        ones, and they will always be yours. Only you can decide how strong and
        energetic your spirit will become as a result of all that is spiritually
        pure. No matter what you have ever been told, you are the only one who
        has total authority over your own life force. No power or force that
        exists in the darkness can possess or control your own spirit or soul,
        except you and you alone. It is yours, and it will always be a part of
        who you are. Unless, of course, you temporarily believe something that
        is not the truth, then your spirit can become a prisoner of something
        other than the truth or a victim of a stronger force. Even then, your
        soul remains yours, but you are a prisoner or slave due to a lack of
        control. One can regain authority by gaining spiritual strength and
        surrendering to all that is holy. You alone are the only one who has
        ultimate authority over your spirit through your own energy, force,
        power, and will. And anything, anyone, or anywhere that is questionable
        or opposing, do not allow your thoughts to wander there, because they
        will be influenced by negative forces, and your spirit will follow suit.
        The spirit of self is directly connected to the energies of
        self-thought. They are independent and separate, though when joined,
        they become a force of their own. Negative thoughts attract negative
        energies and repel positive energies against one's will. This is the
        nature of supernatural spirits. Your thoughts will not leave your mind,
        but your spirit can go anywhere and at any time, as it surely does. And
        it will do it without your knowledge or control. If it goes where it
        shouldn't, and if the spirit is not strong enough with the union of the
        Holy Spirit, it can easily become captive. And if the spirit becomes
        captive, then so can one's thoughts. You don't want to leave your spirit
        vulnerable without protection. So, teach your thoughts and spirit to be
        mindful of all that is holy.    Likewise, if self-spirit dwells on all
        that is holy, it attracts positive forces of influence and blesses all
        that it meets. It repels all that is negative, and it happens instantly.
        If thoughts are focused on righteousness, then one can control their
        thoughts and spirit to the fullest degree; this is total spiritual
        freedom. This must be accomplished to be able to achieve the kind of
        spiritual strength that is needed to venture into the holiest of realms.
        With spiritual growth, determination, prayers, and will, transformation
        changes the state of mind and the state of spirit to reap blessings and
        rewards while getting closer to the Holy Spirit. It is best not to
        venture into the spiritual unknown until your understanding of good and
        evil is strong enough. One must be strong enough to walk through the
        valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil, because the Holy Spirit
        dwells within their soul. And one must be strong enough to stand before
        Christ and know they did all they could to please him by the way they
        lived their lives. Do not let life pass you by without learning the
        truths of good and evil. If one is blinded by the light and darkness
        now, they will be blinded when they get to the other side. Trust me, you
        don’t want to be blinded over there. You must understand the truths and
        the lies before you can move further into the heavens, even closer
        towards the brightest and holiest light of them all. There will be much
        to learn along the way; after all, that is the purpose of everlasting
        life. So, prepare yourself now for the future that is coming. Enough of
        that for now; we’ll get back to that later. Let’s get back to spirit.
        Your spirit is a part of your total entity and is never apart. When it's
        time to leave this world, the combinations of the conditions of your
        conscience, your spirit, and your soul are what determine where in the
        heavenly realms you will go. It's not where you want to go; it's where
        you deserve to go, to where your spirit and soul are already joined.
        That's where it's been living outside of itself; that’s where it
        belongs. Yes, you are a part of the great force that constitutes the
        corporeal universe and the spiritual realms, and you have the gift of
        life as well as the gift of free will to choose what is most important
        to you. So, prepare to live within heavenly dimensions of all that is
        holy, because life continues beyond this world, just as Jesus told us.
        Never doubt or question the promises of our Holy Lord; that alone is
        enough to stop or slow down one’s spiritual growth. You consist of both
        spiritual and physical matter. Just as matter has mass, the spiritual
        being that is you is entirely made up of spiritual energy. Your
        existence, your life force, is a combination of consciousness, a living
        soul, and a living spirit. And because we are a spiritual force, our
        forces are automatically joined with other energies, forces, and powers.
        This is just a fact of one's own spiritual life that cannot and will not
        ever change. You choose everything that your spirit connects with based
        on your own values and morals. For better or worse, we are both a part
        of and separate from all of creation, influenced by either light or
        darkness. If one is influenced by both, when you enter the afterlife,
        you cannot take your darkness into the realms of light. There is no
        middle ground; they both have their own orders and cannot deviate from
        them. The darkness will never let you see its true color but will hide
        behind a light of its own. It will convince you that its wonders and
        miracles are the only truth that matters most. Without the Holy Spirit
        living inside your heart and your soul, you will be fooled, and the
        light of darkness will lead you into despair, while the light of the
        Holy Spirit always shares and reveals all the hidden truths of all that
        is light and all that is dark. As for spirit and the spiritual, which
        all exist outside all that is of self, everything that is tangible in
        this material world that we live in and in all that is in the universe
        that exists consists of spiritual matter as well. Which means that all
        creation is both material in one form or another and spiritual in one
        form or another. For those who live in the spirit and do not doubt, the
        tangible and the spiritual are one and the same. As Christians, we can
        easily accept this truth without doubt because Christ and the prophets
        proved it to us when they were living on Earth. We are blessed to be of
        body and spirit both, to be one with all of God's creation. For all that
        you are is also all that is made of the heavens; for you are a piece of
        it all, and God loves you so very much, longing for you to discover his
        truths. Now that you know how important it is to have total control over
        your thoughts and spirit, this will help with the conditioning and
        strengthening of your faith. These forces are just a few of many that
        are one's gifts of life and must be strong for any successful spiritual
        journey. We have taken only the first steps in preparing for our
        excursion. And for all that your spirit yearns for, you must learn about
        all the powers and forces of the heavens so that you will not lack
        knowledge or strength. Just get yourself together and ask Jesus to teach
        you, and he will reveal everything. Give it time, for soon you will
        learn what lies on the other side, and your spiritual awareness will
        begin to flourish and guide you into all that is spiritually unknown.

      <p>
        We are spirit and soul before anything else, learning first and foremost
        how to connect with the spiritual, which connects with God. We first
        learn to feel the highest spiritual powers that connect our souls to and
        from the heavens above. Through faith, it is revealed that everything we
        understand to be reality has a spiritual and supernatural definition of
        its own. In the beginning, we couldn't see it, touch it, or feel it, but
        we knew in our hearts and souls that it existed through faith. We knew
        that there was something more out there that was waiting to be
        discovered. We felt its presence and its power. As our faith grew, the
        fruition of all that exists in the heavens began to be revealed and
        began to make sense. We learned how to look from the inside out and from
        the outside in by connecting with the Holy Spirit of God. Which allowed
        for the mysteries and powers of the spiritual realms, their dimensions,
        and the heavens to begin to be seen. This is how faith in the Holy
        Spirit works. I am only beginning to learn, though what has been
        revealed to me is meant to be shared with you. Take these words with an
        open mind that does not doubt the unimaginable and unexplainable, and be
        blessed to reap the rewards. As we all know, this world contains
        independent spiritual realms and other dimensions that coexist within
        its vicinity. Which means that all are accessible through faith. Which
        means that spiritual realms are spiritual dimensions capable of
        connecting with other spiritual realms that each possess different and
        similar spiritual definitions and qualities. These spiritual and
        supernatural realms may or may not depend on this world and may or may
        not coexist within its closest proximities. As well as many others that
        are closest and are separated by boundaries and authorities. Which means
        that we are all living in the same spiritual and supernatural world here
        on Earth, mentally and physically, though we are also living in our own
        individual, separate spiritual realms by faith, which can be defined as
        spiritual levels. Because all spiritual realms are divided by individual
        spiritual levels of faith. And each individual spiritual level contains
        its own spiritual and supernatural qualities. Each has their own
        authorities to keep order from chaos. Each has its own populations of
        entities, beings, and authorities, and each has its own histories of
        evolution from which they derive their own truths. This little blue
        world that we live in is not only tangible; it is also spiritual and
        supernatural. Though that doesn't mean that we are all living in the
        same spiritual world, because we are all not, we define our own
        individual spiritual realities by faith. The spiritual realms are all on
        different levels. And the levels are what define the spiritual realms.
        And the level of faith in oneself determines the relam, or realms, one
        is connected with in spirit. We share these realms with others who are
        of like-minded faith. We each live within our own individual spiritual
        realities, and there are countless individual and communal spiritual
        extremes that exist. Everything that exists in the universe contains
        spiritual and supernatural qualities. And depending on the faith of
        one's spirit and soul, this defines closeness to God. Heaven and all
        realms are linked to this world that we live in. It is only a matter of
        faith to connect with them all. All are connected within the spiritual,
        which coexists within all that is within reach of the light of God. It's
        not about distance; it's about the quality and quantity of faith in each
        individual. This little blue world we temporarily call home was created
        for many reasons, though one of the most important is for us to learn
        where it resides within the spiritual realms. In this world, our daily
        spiritual condition is determined by our spiritual journey and by what
        we do with the faith we learn about. For revelation to occur, one must
        be in search of spiritual truths. And as faith grows, the more spiritual
        and supernatural facts of life we learn about, until eventually it all
        begins to make sense. Spiritual realms can be defined only by the faith
        of the one who experiences them. These revelations are freely given to
        all to learn from once one's faith elevates to see the hidden truths.
        The spiritual and supernatural realms contain the entire universe, just
        as the universe contains the spiritual realms. Therefore, because we
        each have our own individual faith, we each experience our own spiritual
        and supernatural experiences and revelations in our own individual ways.
        This world that we share shares the same space and time with all the
        spiritual realms that are closest to it, just like our conscious and
        body share the same space and time with our own spirit and soul. It's
        all about continual spiritual learning as faith grows to recognize the
        truths of how they are joined. If we do nothing for spiritual growth, we
        cannot spiritually advance to reach the next level of maturity.
        Spiritual growth is an educational process built on levels, and
        depending on what level one is at, that is all that determines the next
        spiritual level one advances to. And then, eventually, when it comes
        time to leave this world, the level of faith that we have attained is
        considered as to where within the spiritual realms one is destined to go
        when our conscious, spirit, and soul are ready to go to a higher level.
        We know we have to eventually leave, and we all want to get to Heaven,
        though without learning the truths of Holy Scripture, one can easily get
        detoured or lost along the way by believing truths that are not of God
        and not knowing their lack of faith has led them astray. The truth is
        easily found in communion and communication with the Holy Spirit, and
        the truth will set you free. And once found, faith, spirit, and soul
        become joined to allow all that is hidden to be seen. The truth shows us
        the direction we must follow to find ultimate spiritual prosperity.
        Truth alone is a power all to itself, and once found, it shares its
        powers for strength and bonds that continuously form and grow. We live
        in a terrestrial world that is also celestial. All that is capable of
        being seen is only a glimpse of much greater truths that anticipate your
        union through spirit with their own. The celestial wants to share all of
        its love and all of its secrets with you. All one has to do to reap
        their blessings is raise their faith to their own spiritual level. This
        is our ultimate goal: to prepare ourselves to leave this world. This is
        where the spiritual realms begin to trust you. Between Earth and Heaven,
        there are countless spiritual and heavenly realms that exist where many
        life forms live. These are their homes. Some have been there since the
        beginning of time as we know it. Some were sent there to reap spiritual
        blessings. And some went there when their souls left this world. Just
        know that there is a spiritual hierarchy that lies between Earth and
        Heaven. And just know that outside of Earth and Heaven, there is also
        another hierarchy that exists between Earth and hell. And the realms are
        just as real and tangible as the Earth. They exist beyond our own
        awareness of their dimensions, though they are nearby. The people that
        live there are alive, just like us, and consist of mass and matter
        similar to our own, though with different qualities of supernatural
        realities. It varies in each realm, though the closer it is to Heaven,
        the more overwhelmingly awesome it becomes. All spiritual realms contain
        different qualities and quantities of both light and darkness How many
        heavenly and spiritual realms are there? No one knows, except God. There
        could be as many as there are stars in the universe. Which I assume that
        there possibly are. Especially when you take into account that our God
        is the God of love. Who freely gives to each and everyone who reaches
        out to Heaven everything we need or want. He spoils all with his love
        when your own love is felt within his heart. What I do know is that
        every spiritual realm has its own different extremes in both the powers
        of light and darkness. In Heaven, there is no darkness; there is only
        light. And the light of God reigns supreme in Heaven, within all
        heavenly realms, and within all that exists in creation. Why? Because
        God is a spiritual and supernatural light. Who has authority and power
        over all that exists in light and darkness. And the closer the realms
        are to Heaven, the more light there is. And the closer the realms are to
        hell, the more darkness there is. And between Heaven and hell is where
        all spiritual and heavenly realms exist, including this world, our
        current home. Each and every realm is completely different. Each has its
        own spirits, powers, and authorities. It's about having faith to
        distinguish truth from lies. The spiritual realms connected to this
        world are separated by spirits, forces, powers, and authorities for
        dominance and control. Within each, they are divided, and each side is
        united in their division. All that exists in darkness avoids the light,
        and all that exists in light avoids the darkness. And each is ruled by
        different laws of natural and supernatural truth. There are two kinds of
        followers: those who believe that God is the living light, the ultimate
        authority, who has complete control over their lives, and those who
        refuse to believe the truth. And then there are those who do not know
        the definitions of spiritual light or spiritual darkness who are lost
        and are fooled. Acknowledging that one is spiritual means having to
        choose between being loyal to the light or the darkness. And because we
        are of this world, we are blessed to be able to distinguish the
        differences, with assistance from higher heavenly powers for strength to
        endure, and to learn how to connect to divine spiritual realms, thus
        bringing us closer to both Heaven and God. Routes, doors, and portals to
        enter or exit the spiritual realms As there are routes to take in this
        world to get to various locations, there are also routes to take into
        all spiritual and heavenly realms. These are routes, doors, or portals
        that connect each and every realm. To learn how they function, one must
        learn that they are all connected by the strength of faith. And by the
        power of the Holy Spirit that one's spirit and soul connect with. The
        two work together to make it possible. And the keys that open the
        passageways to enter or exit within come from the spiritual strengths
        that come from the depth of knowledge of the divine Holy Scriptures of
        God. For those who do not doubt one single word of Holy Scripture, they
        are given the spiritual keys to experience revelations and learn all the
        spiritual and supernatural truths that the Holy Spirit chooses to share.
        If you feel the Holy Spirit, like I know you do, know that you are being
        called to be drawn nearer. Faith, love, hope, and truth are four of the
        strongest energies, forces, and powers to pray for and learn about.
        Which are also the keys to gaining entrance to or exiting the spiritual
        and heavenly realms. Once you begin to learn what these energies want,
        they begin to reveal the secrets to gaining entrance to and from the
        spiritual and heavenly realms. Knowledge of the spirit, soul, and light
        of self will be revealed once one learns of the light of God. It happens
        as faith grows. It's only a matter of devotion and time before all is
        revealed. In its most basic form, through the mystery of faith, this is
        how easily divine intervention and prayers work; we are directly
        connected to Heaven and God through our unwavering love. When faith is
        involved, the spirit of self is capable of unimaginable possibilities.
